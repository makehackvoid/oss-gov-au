# Register of Australian Government Open Source Software

We have http://data.gov.au to help find Australian Government open data sets, but there doesn't appear to be an register for open software that has been released or contibuted to by Australian Government agencies.

As a first starting point:

* Geoscience Australia (http://www.ga.gov.au/)
  * https://github.com/ga-m3dv 
* National Archives (http://www.naa.gov.au/)
  * http://xena.sourceforge.net/
* National Library Australia (https://www.nla.gov.au/)
  * https://github.com/nla
* ...

What fields would be useful in a register?

* Agency Name
* Project Name
* Description
* repository
* licence
* ...

What about projects that agencies contribute to?
